This project was bootstrapped with [Create Eth App](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app) and the [Ocean Template](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/create-eth-app/tree/develop/templates/ocean).

This template contains two packages:

- [contracts](/packages/contracts)
- [react-app](/packages/react-app)

The React app implements a basic example for how to connect to and pull data from the [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com/).

## What is Ocean Protocol?
